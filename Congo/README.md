For this project, we are utilizing QGIS as a geographical software tool to read input data modeled by the software. 
Our goal is to utilize information pertaining historical patrols and signs of human activities (e.g., poaching, camping) 
recorded during poaching patrols in the Republic of Congo and use machine learning in order to analyze and predict 
human activity.
